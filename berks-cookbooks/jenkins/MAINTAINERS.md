# Maintainers

This file lists how the jenkins cookbook project is maintained. When making changes
to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need a
simple majority of maintainers to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally,
you need to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.
